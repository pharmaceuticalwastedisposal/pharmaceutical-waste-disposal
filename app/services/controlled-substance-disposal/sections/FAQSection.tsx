                Can controlled substances be returned for credit?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Yes, through reverse distribution. DEA-registered reverse distributors can accept eligible controlled substances 
                for credit. We connect you with authorized reverse distributors who handle the entire process.

                What happens if I don't properly dispose of controlled substances?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Improper disposal can result in DEA fines up to $1.3 million per violation, loss of DEA registration, 
                criminal charges, and facility closure. Proper disposal protects your license and facility.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                You receive complete documentation including: DEA Form 41 approval, witness destruction certificates, 
                chain of custody forms, certificates of destruction, and inventory reconciliation reports for your records.

                How quickly can controlled substances be picked up?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Emergency pickups can be scheduled within 24-48 hours. Regular pickups are typically scheduled within 
                5-7 business days. We coordinate with DEA-registered partners to ensure fast, compliant collection.

                Who can witness controlled substance destruction?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Two authorized employees of your facility must witness the destruction process per DEA requirements. 
                These witnesses must sign DEA Form 41 and the certificate of destruction. Our partners coordinate 
                witness scheduling to ensure compliance.

                Can I dispose of controlled substances on-site?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Yes, with proper DEA authorization. Some facilities have on-site destruction capabilities, but most 
                use our network of mobile destruction units or transport to licensed facilities. On-site destruction 
                still requires DEA Form 41 and witness requirements.

                What's the difference between disposal and reverse distribution?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Disposal destroys medications with no credit value, while reverse distribution returns eligible 
                medications to manufacturers for credit. Our partners evaluate your inventory to maximize credit 
                opportunities and minimize disposal costs.

                Do you handle controlled substances for veterinary practices?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Yes, our network includes specialists who handle veterinary controlled substances. Veterinary 
                practices must follow the same DEA requirements as human medical facilities, including Form 41 
                documentation and witness destruction.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Schedule I and II substances require the highest security and documentation. Fentanyl, oxycodone, 
                and morphine need secure transport and witnessed destruction. Our partners are experienced with 
                all schedule classifications and their specific requirements.
